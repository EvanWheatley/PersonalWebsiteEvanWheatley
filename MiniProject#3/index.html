      I was born in markham and lived there for the first twelve years of my life.
      Most of my childhood years were spent on the ice, figure skating.  My mother
      didnâ€™t want me to play hockey as she thought it was too violent so the only
      real option for me to skate was figure skating.  After a few years of training
      I developed into quite a good skater and upon moving to Huntsville in 1998
      I began competing in the competitive stream.  I had success and twice placed
      first in the NOSIC competition for juvenile and pre novice skating.  With
      these results I was invited to compete in the Tomorrows champions and
      Western Challenge where I placed 13th and and 25th respectively.  Though
      I enjoyed skating I wasn't quite good enough to be a national champion and
      with the expenses of the sport adding up I quit.  At the peak I was
      spending 30 hours per week on the ice and skating at three different
      clubs and once it was gone it took a while for me to fill the void.

      After high school I decided to go to college.  This was a good decision
      however I and my family could not afford to send me so I decided to work
      and save up enough to go.  Even before the end of high school I was hired
      at a local factory that made waste management equipment I was solely
      responsible for cleaning the welds of 50 welders to prep the equipment for
      painting.  After 6 months I applied at another factory that was closer to
      home and got hired when i was just 18 (the minimum age to work there).
      This factory made plastic high pressure fittings and pipe.  I worked
      and excelled there for a year and a half before going on a 6 week trip
      to Europe and beginning college.

      College was a very good experience and I met many very interesting people.
      I did well and after two years got my technician diploma.  After college
      finding a job in my field proved difficult and I moved back to markham
      to work in another factory making feed screws.  I spent almost two years
      there and mastered the processes that I was responsible for
      (cylindrical OD grinding) and figured i would take another shot at
      working in my field of study.  I found a job installing solar panels
      on roofs and very much enjoyed it for three years until getting laid
      off because of downturns in the industry (the clawing back of government
      subsidies).

      After getting laid off I decided I would return to school and took a number
      of employment classes to try to pinpoint what industry I should aim to work
      in.  In these workshops I scored highest in applied science and the IT
      industry.  I then heard through one of my employment counsellors about
      the NPower Canada program and it seemed like a natural fit.  I applied
      and was thankfully accepted and am now well on the way to achieving their
      certification.  I am excited that I have a bright future in the IT
      industry and am anxiously awaiting my chance to prove myself in the
      working world again.    </p>
